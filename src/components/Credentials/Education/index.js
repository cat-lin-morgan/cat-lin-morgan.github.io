    //                 I attended my local community college part time straight out of high school. Over the course of four years took all of the courses they had available for Fine Arts. My focus was not to graduate, but to round out my creative skill set. The skills I gained during this time directly influneced my direction in Web Development and translated surprisingly well. Illustration, Animation, Graphic Design, Printmaking were among the courses I took.
