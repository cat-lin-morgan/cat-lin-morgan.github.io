# Super Duper React Portfolio

## Description


**Other:** I decided to change some of the way my portfolio page is laidout versus the challenge example. There were things I felt worked better for me and what I wanted. The hover state on my image previews only have an external link hover so they can click anywhere and it will take them to the website they are previewing, while I decided I liked the link to each respective repo to the side.

**To Note:** My resume is located at the bottom of My Credentials, as I wanted to lay out my skills and break down my education. My resume is located in two places for ease of access. In my footer and in the resume component.
